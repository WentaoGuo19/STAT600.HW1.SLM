STAT600.HW1.SLM Univariate OLS with Rcpp

A tiny R package that fits a simple ordinary least squares linear
regression with one numeric predictor and one numeric response. Core
math runs in C++ via Rcpp; the R wrapper handles input checks and NA/Inf
filtering. This is the HW1 for STAT 600 at Colorado State University.
